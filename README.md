# Statistical Analysis and Prediction of Graduate Admission Chances

According to the annual [Opendoors](https://opendoorsdata.org/annual-release/international-students/#fast-facts) report, the total number of international students moving to the US for their education increased by 12 percent in the year 2022-23. To complete the application process for a university, an international student must have their exam scores (GRE and TOEFL), a good CGPA standing, a Statement of Purpose and a few Letters of Recommendation. Other than this, each person’s probability of getting into a university depends on the university’s ranking as well. 

As a graduate international student, I have always wondered if there is a way to find out my chances of getting into specific universities given my profile. This mini-research delves into prediction and analysis of one's chances of getting into a university using the data by Jamboree Education in Kaggle at the same time answers some interesting questions that graduate students might have.
